# Individual Contributor License Agreement (CLA) for Algoritmica GmbH

Thank you for your interest in contributing to projects maintained by Algoritmica GmbH ("we" or "us"). This Contributor License Agreement ("Agreement") documents the rights granted by contributors to Algoritmica GmbH. To make this process as straightforward as possible, please review and sign this Agreement.

## 1. Definitions
"You" (or "Your") shall mean the individual who Submits a Contribution to us.
"Contribution" shall mean any original work of authorship, including any modifications or additions to an existing work, that is intentionally Submitted by You to Algoritmica GmbH for inclusion in, or documentation of, any of the products owned or managed by us (the "Work"). For the purposes of this definition, "Submitted" means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent to Algoritmica GmbH or its representatives, including but not limited to communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems, and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, Algoritmica GmbH for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise designated in writing by You as "Not a Contribution."

## 2. Grant of Copyright License
Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, You hereby grant to Algoritmica GmbH and to recipients of software distributed by Algoritmica GmbH a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute Your Contributions and such derivative works.

## 3. Grant of Patent License
Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, You hereby grant to Algoritmica GmbH and to recipients of software distributed by Algoritmica GmbH a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work, where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by You that are necessarily infringed by Your Contribution(s) alone or by combination of Your Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) were Submitted. If any entity institutes patent litigation against You or any other entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that Your Contribution, or the Work to which You have contributed, constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to that entity under this Agreement for that Contribution or Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

## 4. You Represent that You Have the Right to Grant This License
You represent that You are legally entitled to grant the above licenses. If Your employer(s) have rights to intellectual property that You create, You represent that You have received permission to make the Contributions on behalf of that employer, or that Your employer has waived such rights for Your Contributions to Algoritmica GmbH.

## 5. You Represent that Each Contribution is Your Original Work
You represent that each of Your Contributions is Your original creation (see section 7 for submissions on behalf of others). You represent that Your Contribution submissions include complete details of any third-party license or other restriction (including, but not limited to, related patents and trademarks) of which You are personally aware and which are associated with any part of Your Contributions.

## 6. You Are Not Expected to Provide Support for Your Contribution
Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, You provide Your Contributions on an "AS IS" basis, without warranties or conditions of any kind, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of title, non-infringement, merchantability, or fitness for a particular purpose.

## 7. Contributions That You Do Not Own
Should You wish to submit work that is not Your original creation, You may submit it to Algoritmica GmbH separately from any Contribution, identifying the complete details of its source and of any license or other restriction (including, but not limited to, related patents, trademarks, and license agreements) of which You are personally aware, and conspicuously marking the work as "Submitted on behalf of a third party: [named here]".

## 8. No Obligation to Use
You understand that the decision to include Your Contribution in any project or source repository is entirely at the discretion of Algoritmica GmbH and that this Agreement does not obligate Algoritmica GmbH to use Your Contribution in any product, service, or project.

## 9. Notify Us of Any Changes
You agree to notify Algoritmica GmbH of any facts or circumstances of which You become aware that would make these representations inaccurate in any respect.

## 10. Signatures
By submitting a pull request, issue, or comment, You signify agreement to these terms and conditions.
