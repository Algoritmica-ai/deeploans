# Deeploans Overview

Deeploans is an open-source **ETL** framework designed for working with **loan-level**, **economic**, and **alternative credit data**. It extracts, cleans, transforms, and standardizes **structured finance datasets**, making them easier to use in analytics, machine learning models, and financial applications.

Initially developed as an advanced risk analytics tool for portfolio managers, Deeploans evolved into an open data infrastructure project to address the industry-wide challenge of **inconsistent** and **fragmented financial data**. It enables users to:

- Ingest loan-level datasets from multiple sources.
- Process and standardize data formats for easier integration.
- **Validate** and **clean** incomplete or inconsistent records.
- Output **better-structured data** suitable for analysis, modeling, or reporting.

Deeploans is designed for analysts, data scientists, and developers working with financial data who need an efficient and cost-effective way to handle structured datasets without relying on third-party providers. It supports modern data workflows and removes the bottlenecks associated with manual data preparation.

Deeploans has released ETLs for the following structured finance datasets:

- Auto Loans
- SME Loans
- Consumer Loans
- Residential Mortgages

# Deeploans Background

Deeploans began as an AI-powered analytics tool designed to help portfolio managers predict default risk. 

However, we quickly recognised a fundamental challenge: before the market can adopt more advanced tools, it needs clean and better-structured data.

Thus, deeploans evolved into an open data infrastructure project. Today, deeploans solves the fragmented, inconsistent and incomplete data problem in structured finance, enabling analysts and developers to build better tools.
